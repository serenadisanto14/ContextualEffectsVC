This repository contains the code to reproduce the results in 
The combination of feedforward and feedback processing accounts for contextual effects in visual cortex

GHcode_SSN1celltype.cpp allows to simulate the minimal model (once the inputs are set -- from data preprocessing) 

GHcode_Figures.nb allows to produce figures for the minimal model contained in the main paper and supplementary. contains analytical solution of the minimal model

GHcode_SSN4celltypes_data.cpp allows to simulate the 4 cell types model (once the connectivity parameters are inferred)

GHcode_Figures4ctModel.nb allows to infer the connectivity parameters through the Non Negative Least Squares Protocol and to produce figures for the 4 cell types model
